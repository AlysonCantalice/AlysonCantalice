## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alyson, a Brazilian student on a journey to explore the ever-evolving world of technology, and I'm here to share some of my experiences.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Science & Technology at UFABC (Universidade Federal do ABC) and plan to specialize in Computer Science.
